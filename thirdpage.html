                                    "The Call of the Wild" is a compelling novel about a dog's journey,<br>

                                    with his wild side, he must choose between loyalty to his master and his desire<br>
                                    for freedom.The novel is a classic exploration of the primal nature of animal<br>
                                    and humans' relationship with them.

                                        angry. But his strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he knew nothing when,<br>
                                        the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car.<br>
                                        The next he knew, he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that<br>
                                        he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance. The hoarse shriek<br>
                                        of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was. He had travelled<br>
                                        too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of riding in a baggage
                                        car.<br>
                                        He opened his eyes, and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnapped
                                        king.<br>
                                        The man sprang for his throat, but Buck was too quick for him. His jaws
                                        closed<br>
                                        on the hand, nor did they relax till his senses were choked out of him once
                                        more.<br><br>

                                        "Yep, has fits," the man said, hiding his mangled hand from the baggageman,<br>
                                        who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle. "I'm takin' 'm up for the boss

                                        'Frisco. A crack dog-doctor there thinks that he can cure 'm."<br><br>

                                        Concerning that night's ride, the man spoke most eloquently for himself, in a
                                        long race.<br>
